An MCP server for LMS Polinema. Gives AI agents access to your courses, assignments, deadlines, and materials.

Works with Claude Code, Cursor, Antigravity, or any MCP-compatible client.

## How it works

Polinema does not allow direct Moodle logins with student credentials. Authentication flows through an institutional single sign-on chain: SIAKAD (academic portal) → SLC (SPADA gateway) → LMSSLC (Moodle).

On first run, `auth.py` authenticates via SIAKAD (NIM and password) using HTTP requests (`httpx`), exchanges tokens through SLC, and captures the authenticated `MoodleSession`. Session cookies are saved to `~/.lms_polinema/`. When a session expires, the server re-authenticates automatically in the background without requiring browser binaries.

## Tools

| Tool | Parameters | Returns |
|---|---|---|
| `lms_list_courses` | - | Enrolled courses for the current semester |
| `lms_list_assignments` | `course_id` (int, optional) | Assignments, optionally filtered by course |
| `lms_get_assignment_detail` | `assignment_id` (int) | Instructions, attachments, submission status |
| `lms_list_materials` | `course_id` (int) | Material links and metadata (slides, jobsheets, folders) |
| `lms_check_deadlines` | - | Deadline summary across all courses |

## Installation

Requires Python 3.11+ and [uv](https://astral.sh/uv).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hafidzrafi/lms-polinema-mcp.git
cd lms-polinema-mcp
uv sync
```

Run once to set up credentials:

```bash
uv run auth.py
```

Credentials are stored as plaintext JSON at `~/.lms_polinema/credentials.json` (`0600` permissions).

## Configuration

Add to your MCP client config:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "lms-polinema": {
      "command": "uv",
      "args": ["run", "--directory", "/path/to/lms-polinema-mcp", "lms-polinema-mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

Or use the virtualenv directly:

**macOS / Linux:** `.venv/bin/python -m lms_polinema_mcp.server`

**Windows:** `.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m lms_polinema_mcp.server`

Settings can be overridden via environment variables or a `.env` file:

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `LMS_POLINEMA_HTTP_TIMEOUT` | `20.0` | Request timeout (seconds) |
| `LMS_POLINEMA_COURSE_CACHE_TTL_SECONDS` | `1800` | Course list cache lifetime |
| `LMS_POLINEMA_SESSION_CACHE_TTL_SECONDS` | `300` | Session validation cache lifetime |
| `LMS_POLINEMA_SIAKAD_BASE_URL` | `https://siakad.polinema.ac.id` | SIAKAD portal URL |
| `LMS_POLINEMA_MOODLE_BASE_URL` | `https://lmsslc.polinema.ac.id` | Moodle URL |

See [`.env.example`](.env.example) for the full list.

## Web app

A local browser UI is included. From this folder:

```bash
cd frontend && npm install && npm run build && cd ..
uv run lms-polinema-web
```

Open `http://127.0.0.1:8787`.

The hosted deploy reads `LMS_POLINEMA_NIM` and `LMS_POLINEMA_PASSWORD` from the server environment instead of `~/.lms_polinema/credentials.json`. Set `LMS_POLINEMA_ACCESS_KEY` as well. Without that key, the public URL refuses to show courses.

## Known limitations
 
- All data is retrieved by scraping HTML. The Moodle Web Services API is disabled on this instance.
- All operations are currently read-only; assignment submission is not supported.
- `lms_list_materials` returns resource links and metadata, not downloaded file contents.
- Courses without an active Moodle link configured by the lecturer will return `moodle_id: null`.
- Sessions expire after ~30 min idle. Re-auth happens automatically in the background.
- SSL verification is disabled for `lmsslc.polinema.ac.id` and `slc.polinema.ac.id` due to a missing intermediate CA.
